Any contributions should follow the guidelines outlined below.

As a general rule, I will ignore any and all contributions that appear to use LLMs/AI.

For issues/bug reports, try to provide:

- The current version that experiences the issue
  - Current version information can be seen via the 'Thanks' page 
  - Hold Z on port 4 on the main menu to show it
- If applicable, the oldest version that also experiences the issue
- The platform used (GameCube, Wii, Dolphin). For Dolphin, also provide the version used
- Instructions for reproducing the issue, if possible

For pull requests, try to adhere to the following:

- Maintain current code style
- Commits should be focused on a specific change, with a corresponding message
- Commits should not be overly large
- Code should be readable and commented
(use a more readable implementation over a more 'elegant' solution, if possible)
- Changes should not produce any compiler warnings
- Changes should be implemented in C, not C++
- Changes will be licensed under GNU GPLv3
- Code changes should not rely on a specific version of either 
libogc2 or any utilities from the DevkitPro or Extremscorner repos
